The List data type is actually similar to the concept of an array in other programming languages. An array is used to hold multiple values in single variable, similarly in Dart, an array is a List objects that hold multiple objects/values in single variable , so most people just call them lists. A list variable is defined by having values separated by commas and enclosed within square brackets ([]).
